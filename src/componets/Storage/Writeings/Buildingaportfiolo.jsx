    <p>Developer portfolios are an excellent tool for making a lasting impression on potential clients or recruiters. In this article, I'll walk you through how I built my portfolio and the thought process behind it.</p>
    <h2>Things to consider:</h2>
    <p>When i was building my portfolio, i wanted the visitor to be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find my portfolio easily on the internet</li>
      <li>Easily contact me, using either social media or email</li>
      <li>See my projects and what kind of work i do</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Deciding on a theme:</h2>
    <p>Before you start building your portfolio project, it's a good idea to come up with a theme. A good theme describes your personality and what type of work you do. For example, if you are a designer then a theme you could do is modern or abstract. Itâ€™s also worth checking out other portfolios to help get a feel for what theme and content will be on your portfolio website, you can find a huge list of them <a href="https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Your portfolio theme sets the tone for how you present yourself to potential clients or employers. It's like the cover of a book it should give a glimpse of what's inside and entice people to explore further. It's also important to ensure that your theme remains consistent across your website. When I was choosing my theme, I wanted something that would not only reflect my skills and experience but also capture attention and leave a positive impression. After looking through other portfolios for ideas, I decided to go with a creative and modern approach to my theme.</p>
    <p>By opting for a creative and modern theme, I'm signaling to visitors that I try to think out-of-the box and I'm able to keep up with the latest trends in UI design.  Overall, this theme speaks to who I am as a developer; someone who values creativity, and innovation. The bright colors and Font choice, would speak for my personality and show potential recruiters what kind of person I am.
    </p>
    <h2>Key features:</h2>
    <p>Once I settled on a theme, I dived into the project build. For the tech stack, I chose React, Sass, and Bootstrap for the front-end</p>
    <h3>Home page:</h3>
    <p>The home page is the first thing a user sees, as such it's important for it to contain important info while also being easy to navigate / read. When designing this section, my main objective was to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Give the visitor a brief introduction to who i am</li>
      <li>Display my skills, both development and tech related</li>
      <li>Showcase my projects</li>
    </ul>
